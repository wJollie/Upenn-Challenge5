This is a project for the Upenn fullstack development bootcamp. There was starter code provided by the bootcamp in the Html, Css, and Javascript Files.
Everything else is original code written by me with syntax help from google.com and chatgpt.

The application is a calendar that shows time slots for the work day, the color of the time slots change depending on if the slot is in the past, present, or future.

Deployed application: https://wjollie.github.io/Upenn-Challenge5/
